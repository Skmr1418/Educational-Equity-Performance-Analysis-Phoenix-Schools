# Educational-Equity-Performance-Analysis-Phoenix-Schools


The aim of the project is to collect, structure, and analyze educational data from 166 schools across Phoenix, Arizona, to explore how different factors (such as student demographics, educational methods, teacher-student ratios, and availability of mental health services) influence academic performance‚Äîespecially math scores.

Using data collected from reliable educational directories and school websites, the team created a comprehensive dataset with 19 attributes per school. These include institutional characteristics (e.g., city, zip code, enrollment), performance metrics (math scores, national/state rank), and socio-economic indicators (racial distribution, lunch program participation).

üéØ Purpose of the Project:
To build a data-driven understanding of how various school characteristics correlate with academic outcomes.
To identify factors‚Äîsuch as educational method, support services, and socio-economic context‚Äîthat potentially impact student performance in math.
To create a clean, reliable dataset that can serve as a basis for predictive modeling or deeper analytics in later project phases.
üõ†Ô∏è Use Case Possibilities:
Developing predictive models to estimate academic performance.
Performing equity audits to assess disparities between schools.
Informing policy recommendations for improving educational outcomes in under-resourced areas.
